	abstract = {Extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma ({ENKTL}) is an aggressive, rare lymphoma of natural killer ({NK}) cell origin with poor clinical outcomes. Here we used phenotypic and molecular profiling, including epigenetic analyses, to investigate how {ENKTL} ontogeny relates to normal {NK}-cell development. We demonstrate that neoplastic {NK} cells are stably, but reversibly, arrested at earlier stages of {NK}-cell maturation. Genes downregulated in the most epigenetic immature tumors were associated with polycomb silencing along with genomic gain and overexpression of {EZH}2. {ENKTL} cells exhibited genome-wide {DNA} hypermethylation. Tumor-specific {DNA} methylation gains were associated with polycomb-marked regions, involving extensive gene silencing and loss of transcription factor binding. To investigate therapeutic targeting, we treated novel patient-derived xenograft ({PDX}) models of {ENKTL} with the {DNA} hypomethylating agent, 5-azacytidine. Treatment led to reexpression of {NK}-cell developmental genes, phenotypic {NK}-cell differentiation, and prolongation of survival. These studies lay the foundation for epigenetic-directed therapy in {ENKTL}.
{SIGNIFICANCE}: Through epigenetic and transcriptomic analyses of {ENKTL}, a rare, aggressive malignancy, along with normal {NK}-cell developmental intermediates, we identified that extreme {DNA} hypermethylation targets genes required for {NK}-cell development. Disrupting this epigenetic blockade in novel {PDX} models led to {ENKTL} differentiation and improved survival. This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 85.},

We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of these combinations in a period of accelerated approval in Latin-America.Methods: This observational study evaluated adults with acute myeloid leukemia who received venetoclax-based therapy in 11 public or private centers in Mexico and Peru for both newly diagnosed or relapsed and refractory {AML}.Results: Fifty patients were included; 28 with newly diagnosed ({ND}) {AML} and 22 with relapsed/refractory ({RR}) disease. {ND} patients were older (64 vs. 40 years; p {\textless} 0.001) with a lower functional capacity ({ECOG} ≥2 64.3\% vs 9\%; p {\textless} 0.001). Venetoclax was frequently combined with azacytidine (60\%) and prophylactic azoles (82\%) with a median maximum dose of 200 mg (range, 100-600 mg). Hematologic toxicities were common. Complete response rates including patients with incomplete hematopoietic recovery were 78.6\% in {ND} and 45.5\% in {RR} patients, with a median overall survival of 9.6 (95\% {CI} 3.7-15.5) and 8 months (95\% {CI} 4.8-11.2).Discussion: Our study showed a preferred use of venetoclax plus azacytidine over cyatrabine. Patients in the first-line setting were similar to those in the landmark studies, while most patients with relapsed disease had received prior intensive therapies. Responses were favorable, with a median survival in agreement to other reports, albeit shorter than that observed in the randomized phase-3 trials.Conclusion: Venetoclax-based therapy in {AML} was effective despite dose reductions and prophylactic antifungals in two middle-income countries outside of a clinical trial setting.},

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: Anemia is a global public health issue that affects mainly children aged less than 5 years. In Peru, despite the reduction in the prevalence of anemia between 2010 and 2018, anemia remains a major concern, especially in high-risk zones such as rural areas. Several sociodemographic factors have been associated with anemia in children; however, components contributing to the urban-rural gap have not been previously assessed. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the determinants of the difference in anemia prevalence between urban and rural areas, and its spatial distribution in Peruvian children aged 6-59 months.
{METHODS}: A secondary data analysis was conducted using the 2019 Peruvian Demographic Health Survey. The study population included 18 846 children aged 6-59 months. A multivariate decomposition analysis for non-linear response model was performed to identify the factors contributing to the gap in the prevalence of anemia across urban and rural areas. Global Moran\&acute;s I autocorrelation, Ordinary Kriging interpolation and Bernoulli-based purely spatial scan statistics were employed to assess the spatial pattern of anemia.
{RESULTS}: Nationwide, the prevalence of anemia in Peru was 29.47\% (95\%{CI} 28.63-30.33). In rural areas, it was 38.25\%, and in urban areas 26.39\%. The decomposition analysis revealed that 88.61\% of the difference in the prevalence of anemia between urban and rural areas was attributed to the difference in the respondents' characteristics. Wealth index, mother\&acute;s education, mother\&acute;s employment status, number of living children and mother\&acute;s age were key determinants contributing to the rural-urban gap. Spatial heterogeneity of anemia prevalence in childhood was observed at both inter- and intradepartmental level. The {SaTScan} spatial analysis identified six significant cluster areas with high prevalence of anemia in childhood.
{CONCLUSION}: A considerable gap of anemia prevalence between urban and rural areas was found. Targeted interventions are necessary to reduce geographic disparities.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 ({HTLV}-1) is an endemic virus in Latin America that is directly linked to adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma ({ATL}). Previous studies have suggested an oncogenic role of {HTLV}-1 in non-{ATL} neoplasms and have found higher mortality in {HTLV}-1 carriers without {ATL}.
{METHODS}: In this retrospective cohort study, {HTLV}-1 carriers were identified through screening at a tertiary cancer center between 2006 and 2019. We compared the overall survival ({OS}) outcomes of patients with {ATL} with those with other solid or hematologic malignancies by sex stratification.
{RESULTS}: We identified 1,934 {HTLV}-1 carriers diagnosed with cancer. The median age at diagnosis was 62 (range 20-114) years, 76\% were female, 60\% had no or elementary school education, and 50\% were born in the Andean highlands. The most common non-{ATL} neoplasm was cervical cancer (50\%) among females and non-{ATL} non-Hodgkin lymphoma (26\%) among males. With a median follow-up of 66 months, the 5-year {OS} of {HTLV}-1 carriers with non-{ATL} neoplasms (26\%-47\% for females and 22\%-34\% for males) was inferior to those reported in the general population. As expected, patients with {ATL} had a worse prognosis (5-year {OS}: 10\% for females and 8\% for males).
{CONCLUSION}: {HTLV}-1 carriers with cancer were middle age and from underprivileged settings, suggesting an undetected transmission among vulnerable populations, especially females. Survival estimates of {HTLV}-1 carriers with non-{ATL} neoplasms were lower than the regional outcomes. Future research should ascertain how the biology of {HTLV}-1 and health care disparities affect the outcomes of {HTLV}-1 carriers, as well as determine the burden of {HTLV}-1 infection in the cancer population to recommend screening in the outpatient setting of endemic regions.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma ({ATLL}) is an aggressive disease caused by the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1. Real-world data of {ATLL} in Latin America are lacking.
{PATIENTS} {AND} {METHODS}: We analyzed patients with {ATLL} (acute, lymphomatous, chronic, and smoldering) encountered in 11 Latin American countries between 1995 and 2019. Treatment response was assessed according to the 2009 consensus report. Survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test.
{RESULTS}: We identified 253 patients; 226 (lymphomatous: n = 122, acute: n = 73, chronic: n = 26, and smoldering: n = 5) had sufficient data for analysis (median age 57 years). Most patients with {ATLL} were from Peru (63\%), Chile (17\%), Argentina (8\%), and Colombia (7\%). Hypercalcemia was positively associated with acute type (57\% v lymphomatous 27\%, P = .014). The median survival times (months) were 4.3, 7.9, 21.1, and not reached for acute, lymphomatous, chronic, and smoldering forms, with 4-year survival rates of 8\%, 22\%, 40\%, and 80\%, respectively. First-line zidovudine ({AZT})-interferon alfa ({IFN}) resulted in an overall response rate of 63\% (complete response [{CR}] 24\%) for acute. First-line chemotherapy yielded an overall response rate of 41\% ({CR} 29\%) for lymphomatous. {CR} rate was 42\% for etoposide, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and prednisone versus 12\% for cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and prednisone-like regimen (P {\textless} .001). Progression-free survival at 1 year for acute type patients treated with {AZT}-{IFN} was 67\%, whereas 2-year progression-free survival in lymphomatous type patients who achieved {CR} after chemotherapy was 77\%.
{CONCLUSION}: This study confirms Latin American {ATLL} presents at a younger age and has a high incidence of lymphomatous type, low incidence of indolent subtypes, and worse survival rates as compared with Japanese patients. In aggressive {ATLL}, chemotherapy remains the preferred choice for lymphomatous favoring etoposide-based regimen (etoposide, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and prednisone), whereas {AZT}-{IFN} remains a good first-line option for acute subtype.},

However, less is known on the impact of {HTLV}-1 infection in non-{ATLL} hematologic malignancies. We aimed to investigate if {HTLV}-1 carriers with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ({DLBCL}) have worse survival outcomes than non-{HTLV}-1 carriers.
{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}: We performed a single-center retrospective cohort study by matching {HTLV}-1 carriers to non-carriers based on age, sex, Ann Arbor stage, and year of diagnosis. Our outcomes of interest were overall survival ({OS}) and progression-free survival ({PFS}). The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate {OS} and {PFS} between carriers and non-carriers. We fitted multivariate Cox regression models to assess the mortality and recurrence/disease progression risk of {HTLV}-1 infection.
{RESULTS}: A total of 188 patients, 66 with {HTLV}-1 infection and 122 without {HTLV}-1, were included in the study. {HTLV}-1 carriers had higher extranodal involvement than non-carriers (47\% vs. 27\%, P = .010). With a median follow-up of 78 months (95\% {CI}: 41-90 months), {HTLV}-1 carriers had a similar 5 year {OS} (41\% vs. 42\%, P = .940) and {PFS} (34\% vs. 32\%, P = .691) compared to non-carriers.

Coinfection with Strongyloides promotes {ATL} development, suggesting that the immunological status of infected individuals is a determinant of {HTLV}-1 pathogenicity. As {CD}4+ T cells play a central role in host immunity, the deregulation of their function and differentiation via {HTLV}-1 promotes the immune evasion of infected T cells. During {ATL} development, the accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations in key host immunity-related genes further disturbs the immunological balance. Various approaches are available for treating these abnormalities; however, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is currently the only treatment with the potential to cure {ATL}. The patient’s immune state may contribute to the treatment outcome. Additionally, the activity of the anti-{CC} chemokine receptor 4 antibody, mogamulizumab, depends on immune function, including antibody-dependent cytotoxicity.

	abstract = {Epstein-Barr virus ({EBV}) is a potent carcinogen linked to hematologic and solid malignancies and causes significant global morbidity and mortality. Therapy using allogeneic {EBV}-specific lymphocytes shows promise in certain populations, but the impact of {EBV} genome variation on these strategies remains unexplored. To address this, we sequenced 217 {EBV} genomes, including hematologic malignancies from Guatemala, Peru, Malawi, and Taiwan, and analyzed them alongside 1307 publicly available {EBV} genomes from cancer, nonmalignant diseases, and healthy individuals across Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, and South America. These included, to our knowledge, the first natural killer ({NK})/T-cell lymphoma ({NKTCL}) {EBV} genomes reported outside of East Asia. Our findings indicate that previously proposed {EBV} genome variants specific to certain cancer types are more closely tied to geographic origin than to cancer histology. This included variants previously reported to be specific to {NKTCL} but were prevalent in {EBV} genomes from other cancer types and healthy individuals in East Asia. After controlling for geographic region, we did identify multiple {NKTCL}-specific variants associated with a 7.8-fold to 21.9-fold increased risk. We also observed frequent variations in {EBV} genomes that affected peptide sequences previously reported to bind common major histocompatibility complex alleles. Finally, we found several nonsynonymous variants spanning the coding sequences of current vaccine targets {BALF}4, {BKRF}2, {BLLF}1, {BXLF}2, {BZLF}1, and {BZLF}2. These results highlight the need to consider geographic variation in {EBV} genomes when devising strategies for exploiting adaptive immune responses against {EBV}-related cancers, ensuring greater global effectiveness and equity in prevention and treatment. © 2024 by The American Society of Hematology.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ({DLBCL}) are typically treated with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-{CHOP}). However, a standard of care for managing adolescents and young adults ({AYAs}) with {DLBCL} is lacking. We examine treatment approaches and outcomes of this population. Methods: We included 90 {AYAs} (15-39 years) diagnosed with {DLBCL} between 2008 and 2018 in three tertiary centers in Peru. Overall response rates ({ORR}) were available for all patients. Overall survival ({OS}) and progression-free survival ({PFS}) rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: The median age at diagnosis was 33 years, 57\% were males, 57\% had good performance status (Lansky/Karnofsky ≥90), and 61\% were diagnosed with early-stage disease (Ann Arbor stages I-{II}). R-{CHOP} (n = 69, 77\%) was the most frequently used first-line regimen, with an {ORR} of 91\%. With a median follow-up of 83 months, the 5-year {OS} and {PFS} among all patients were 79\% and 67\%, respectively. Among the patients who received R-{CHOP}, the 5-year {OS} and {PFS} were 77\% and 66\%, respectively. Of the 29 (32\%) patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) disease, 83\% received second-line treatment and only 14\% underwent consolidation therapy with autologous transplantation. The 3-year {OS} for R/R {DLBCL} was 36\%. Conclusion: Our data show that {AYAs} with {DLBCL} who received conventional therapy had comparable outcomes to those observed in studies conducted among the adult population. However, the prognosis for {AYAs} with R/R disease was dismal, indicating the unmet need for developing and increasing access to novel treatment modalities in {AYAs}.},

	abstract = {Objective
To systematically evaluate and synthesize the existing evidence from cohort and case-control studies to identify risk factors associated with malignant progression to {ATLL} in {HTLV}-1 carriers.
Methods
A systematic search was conducted in September 2023 in the following databases: Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, Medline and Embase. Only case-control and cohort studies that assessed the risk factors for the malignant progression to {ATLL} among {HTLV}-1 carriers in the adult population were included. The risk of bias was assessed through the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Meta-analysis was not performed due to high statistical and methodological heterogeneity.
Results
After conducting a systematic search, 8,170 results were retrieved, of which 9 (7 case-control and 2 cohort studies) met the selection criteria. Seven of them were conducted in Japan and six had low risk of bias. Serum {sIL}-2R levels, proviral load ({PVL}), cigarette consumption, Scd30 and {TNF}-α-857T allele were associated with an increased risk of {ATLL} progression.
Conclusion
{PVL} emerges as the foremost recommended biomarker for predicting progression in patients with {HTLV}-1 associated {ATLL}. Further studies with larger samples sizes, different populations, more rigorous statistical adjustments, and longer follow-up are warranted.},
