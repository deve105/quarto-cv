	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Previous studies have found that healthcare-associated bacteremia ({HAB}) by Aeromonas species is associated with mortality. However, there is limited data on this outcome in patients with hematologic malignancies. This study aimed to identify the clinical features of patients with malignant hematologic diseases diagnosed with Aeromonas sobria bacteremia and to evaluate whether the type of bacteremia, community-acquired bacteremia ({CAB}) or {HAB}, is associated with mortality.
{METHODS}: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of pediatric and adult patients between January 2000 and December 2017. Clinical characteristics were compared between {CAB} and {HAB}. Additionally, we stratified based on age group. Survival outcomes were assessed with Kaplan-Meier curves and a multivariate Cox regression analysis.
{RESULTS}: A total of 37 patients (median age 24 years) were identified; 23 (62\%) had {HAB} and 14 (38\%) had {CAB}. Overall, the most common presenting symptom was abdominal pain (41\%). Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 12/15, 80\%) and acute myeloid leukemia (n = 8/22, 36\%) were the primary hematologic malignancies in pediatric and adult patients, respectively. {CAB} patients had worse overall survival ({OS}) rates at 30 days in all (43\% versus {HAB} 91\%, p = 0.006) and adult patients (30\% versus {HAB} 92\%, p = 0.002). Cox regression analysis found that quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment and {CAB} were statistically significant factors associated with mortality. Low antimicrobial-resistant was noted, except for ciprofloxacin (n = 5/37, 14\%).
{CONCLUSION}: Our study found a worse {OS} among patients with hematologic malignancies and {CAB} by Aeromonas sobria. Our results suggest that patients with {CAB} present with a worse disease severity. These findings should aid clinicians to determine the survival prognosis in this population.},

	abstract = {Extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma ({ENKTL}) is an aggressive, rare lymphoma of natural killer ({NK}) cell origin with poor clinical outcomes. Here we used phenotypic and molecular profiling, including epigenetic analyses, to investigate how {ENKTL} ontogeny relates to normal {NK}-cell development. We demonstrate that neoplastic {NK} cells are stably, but reversibly, arrested at earlier stages of {NK}-cell maturation. Genes downregulated in the most epigenetic immature tumors were associated with polycomb silencing along with genomic gain and overexpression of {EZH}2. {ENKTL} cells exhibited genome-wide {DNA} hypermethylation. Tumor-specific {DNA} methylation gains were associated with polycomb-marked regions, involving extensive gene silencing and loss of transcription factor binding. To investigate therapeutic targeting, we treated novel patient-derived xenograft ({PDX}) models of {ENKTL} with the {DNA} hypomethylating agent, 5-azacytidine. Treatment led to reexpression of {NK}-cell developmental genes, phenotypic {NK}-cell differentiation, and prolongation of survival. These studies lay the foundation for epigenetic-directed therapy in {ENKTL}.
{SIGNIFICANCE}: Through epigenetic and transcriptomic analyses of {ENKTL}, a rare, aggressive malignancy, along with normal {NK}-cell developmental intermediates, we identified that extreme {DNA} hypermethylation targets genes required for {NK}-cell development. Disrupting this epigenetic blockade in novel {PDX} models led to {ENKTL} differentiation and improved survival. This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 85.},

We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of these combinations in a period of accelerated approval in Latin-America.Methods: This observational study evaluated adults with acute myeloid leukemia who received venetoclax-based therapy in 11 public or private centers in Mexico and Peru for both newly diagnosed or relapsed and refractory {AML}.Results: Fifty patients were included; 28 with newly diagnosed ({ND}) {AML} and 22 with relapsed/refractory ({RR}) disease. {ND} patients were older (64 vs. 40 years; p {\textless} 0.001) with a lower functional capacity ({ECOG} ≥2 64.3\% vs 9\%; p {\textless} 0.001). Venetoclax was frequently combined with azacytidine (60\%) and prophylactic azoles (82\%) with a median maximum dose of 200 mg (range, 100-600 mg). Hematologic toxicities were common. Complete response rates including patients with incomplete hematopoietic recovery were 78.6\% in {ND} and 45.5\% in {RR} patients, with a median overall survival of 9.6 (95\% {CI} 3.7-15.5) and 8 months (95\% {CI} 4.8-11.2).Discussion: Our study showed a preferred use of venetoclax plus azacytidine over cyatrabine. Patients in the first-line setting were similar to those in the landmark studies, while most patients with relapsed disease had received prior intensive therapies. Responses were favorable, with a median survival in agreement to other reports, albeit shorter than that observed in the randomized phase-3 trials.Conclusion: Venetoclax-based therapy in {AML} was effective despite dose reductions and prophylactic antifungals in two middle-income countries outside of a clinical trial setting.},

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: Anemia is a global public health issue that affects mainly children aged less than 5 years. In Peru, despite the reduction in the prevalence of anemia between 2010 and 2018, anemia remains a major concern, especially in high-risk zones such as rural areas. Several sociodemographic factors have been associated with anemia in children; however, components contributing to the urban-rural gap have not been previously assessed. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the determinants of the difference in anemia prevalence between urban and rural areas, and its spatial distribution in Peruvian children aged 6-59 months.
{METHODS}: A secondary data analysis was conducted using the 2019 Peruvian Demographic Health Survey. The study population included 18 846 children aged 6-59 months. A multivariate decomposition analysis for non-linear response model was performed to identify the factors contributing to the gap in the prevalence of anemia across urban and rural areas. Global Moran\&acute;s I autocorrelation, Ordinary Kriging interpolation and Bernoulli-based purely spatial scan statistics were employed to assess the spatial pattern of anemia.
{RESULTS}: Nationwide, the prevalence of anemia in Peru was 29.47\% (95\%{CI} 28.63-30.33). In rural areas, it was 38.25\%, and in urban areas 26.39\%. The decomposition analysis revealed that 88.61\% of the difference in the prevalence of anemia between urban and rural areas was attributed to the difference in the respondents' characteristics. Wealth index, mother\&acute;s education, mother\&acute;s employment status, number of living children and mother\&acute;s age were key determinants contributing to the rural-urban gap. Spatial heterogeneity of anemia prevalence in childhood was observed at both inter- and intradepartmental level. The {SaTScan} spatial analysis identified six significant cluster areas with high prevalence of anemia in childhood.
{CONCLUSION}: A considerable gap of anemia prevalence between urban and rural areas was found. Targeted interventions are necessary to reduce geographic disparities.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Breast cancer incidence in the United States is lower in Hispanic/Latina (H/L) compared with African American/Black or Non-Hispanic White women. An Indigenous American breast cancer-protective germline variant (rs140068132) has been reported near the estrogen receptor 1 gene. This study tests the association of rs140068132 and other polymorphisms in the 6q25 region with subtype-specific breast cancer risk in H/Ls of high Indigenous American ancestry.
{METHODS}: Genotypes were obtained for 5,094 Peruvian women with (1,755) and without (3,337) breast cancer. Associations between genotype and overall and subtype-specific risk for the protective variant were tested using logistic regression models and conditional analyses, including other risk-associated polymorphisms in the region.
{RESULTS}: We replicated the reported association between rs140068132 and breast cancer risk overall [odds ratio ({OR}), 0.53; 95\% confidence interval ({CI}), 0.47-0.59], as well as the lower odds of developing hormone receptor negative ({HR}-) versus {HR}+ disease ({OR}, 0.77; 95\% {CI}, 0.61-0.97). Models, including {HER}2, showed further heterogeneity with reduced odds for {HR}+{HER}2+ ({OR}, 0.68; 95\% {CI}, 0.51-0.92), {HR}-{HER}2+ ({OR}, 0.63; 95\% {CI}, 0.44-0.90) and {HR}-{HER}2- ({OR}, 0.77; 95\% {CI}, 0.56-1.05) compared with {HR}+{HER}2-. Inclusion of other risk-associated variants did not change these observations.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The rs140068132 polymorphism is associated with decreased risk of breast cancer in Peruvians and is more protective against {HR}- and {HER}2+ diseases independently of other breast cancer-associated variants in the 6q25 region.
{IMPACT}: These results could inform functional analyses to understand the mechanism by which rs140068132-G reduces risk of breast cancer development in a subtype-specific manner. They also illustrate the importance of including diverse individuals in genetic studies.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 ({HTLV}-1) is an endemic virus in Latin America that is directly linked to adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma ({ATL}). Previous studies have suggested an oncogenic role of {HTLV}-1 in non-{ATL} neoplasms and have found higher mortality in {HTLV}-1 carriers without {ATL}.
{METHODS}: In this retrospective cohort study, {HTLV}-1 carriers were identified through screening at a tertiary cancer center between 2006 and 2019. We compared the overall survival ({OS}) outcomes of patients with {ATL} with those with other solid or hematologic malignancies by sex stratification.
{RESULTS}: We identified 1,934 {HTLV}-1 carriers diagnosed with cancer. The median age at diagnosis was 62 (range 20-114) years, 76\% were female, 60\% had no or elementary school education, and 50\% were born in the Andean highlands. The most common non-{ATL} neoplasm was cervical cancer (50\%) among females and non-{ATL} non-Hodgkin lymphoma (26\%) among males. With a median follow-up of 66 months, the 5-year {OS} of {HTLV}-1 carriers with non-{ATL} neoplasms (26\%-47\% for females and 22\%-34\% for males) was inferior to those reported in the general population. As expected, patients with {ATL} had a worse prognosis (5-year {OS}: 10\% for females and 8\% for males).
{CONCLUSION}: {HTLV}-1 carriers with cancer were middle age and from underprivileged settings, suggesting an undetected transmission among vulnerable populations, especially females. Survival estimates of {HTLV}-1 carriers with non-{ATL} neoplasms were lower than the regional outcomes. Future research should ascertain how the biology of {HTLV}-1 and health care disparities affect the outcomes of {HTLV}-1 carriers, as well as determine the burden of {HTLV}-1 infection in the cancer population to recommend screening in the outpatient setting of endemic regions.},

{METHODS}: We conducted a retrospective cohort study in {TNBC} female patients with stage I-{IIa}, treated at a single-center during the period of 2000-2014. We estimated and compared the survival rates with the Kaplan Meier and Long-rank test. Propensity scores were calculated with the generalized boosted regression model and were used in the multivariate Cox regression analysis with the covariate adjustment method.
{RESULTS}: We included 288 patients, 111 in the {BCS} vs. 177 in the {TM} group. The median follow-up was 102 months. Moreover, the patients in the {BCS} group had superior {OS} (85\% vs. 81\%, p = 0.56) and {DFS} (83\% vs. 80\%, p = 0.42) at 10 years. In the multivariate Cox analysis, {BCS} decreased the mortality risk ({HR}: 0.79, 95\% {CI}: 0.37-1.67, p = 0.538), and the locoregional or distant recurrence risk ({HR}: 0.67, 95\% {CI}: 0.32-1.41, p = 0.294), albeit with no statistical significance.

We aimed to compare the prognostic value of both {ypN} and {LNR} in patients with residual triple-negative breast cancer ({TNBC}) after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy ({NAC}). This was a retrospective cohort study of patients treated in a tertiary care center during the period 2000-2014. We stratified the population based on {LNR} (≤0.20, 0.20-0.65, and {\textgreater}0.65) and {ypN} (N1, N2, and N3) status. The overall survival ({OS}) and progression-free survival ({PFS}) were estimated with Kaplan-Meier curves and the log-rank + test. We further compared patient mortality and disease recurrence using multivariate Cox regression analysis. We evaluated 169 patients with a median follow-up of 87 months. At 2 years of follow-up, patients with low-risk {LNR} compared to those with moderate and high risk had a higher {PFS} (54\% vs 31\% vs 18\%, respectively; P {\textless} .001) and {OS} (74\% vs 64\% vs 45\%, respectively; P {\textless} .001).

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The aim of this study was to determine the utility of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio ({NLR}) as a biomarker for predicting early-mortality ({\textless}2 years) among females with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer ({mTNBC}).
{METHODS}: We reviewed 118 medical records of females with {mTNBC}. The cut-off value for the {NLR} ({\textless}2.5 and ≥2.5) was determined with receiver operating characteristic curves (area under the curve: 0.73; 95\% {CI}: 0.62-0.85). Survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the Log-rank test. Multivariate Cox regression was used to identify the risk of mortality at two years. Moreover, we performed sensitivity analyses with different cut-off values and a subgroup analysis in females that only received chemotherapy.
{RESULTS}: The median follow-up was 24 months. Females with {NLR} ≥2.5 had a poor overall survival compared to females with {NLR} {\textless}2.5 (6\% vs. 28\%, p{\textless}0.001) at two years. This outcome remained when we stratified for females that only received chemotherapy (8\% vs. 36\%, p = 0.001).

{CONCLUSION}: The {NLR} is an accessible and reliable biomarker that predicts early mortality among females with {mTNBC}. Our results suggest that females with high {NLR} values have poor prognosis despite receiving standard chemotherapy. Health providers should evaluate the possibility to enroll these patients in novel immunotherapy trials.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Lung cancer is still a prevalent and fatal neoplasm in developing countries. In the last decades, chemotherapy ({CHT}) maintenance occupied an important role in the treatment, as well as targeted therapies. We aimed to evaluate the survival impact of targeted therapy in advanced lung cancer at a private Peruvian institution (Oncosalud - {AUNA}).
{METHODS}: We reviewed retrospectively medical records of patients with advanced-stage non-small cell lung cancer ({NSCLS}) (clinical stage {III}-{IV}) who received {CHT} and maintenance treatment with target therapy ({TT}) or {CHT}. The impact was assessed by progression-free survival ({PFS}) and overall survival ({OS}) using the Kaplan-Meier method, and comparisons of survival curves were performed using log-rank or Breslow test and Cox model.
{RESULTS}: The median age of the patients was 65 years. Clinical characteristics, as well as the treatment type, showed no significant difference between the two groups. The maintenance schedule in those receiving {CHT} was generally pemetrexed (70\%) and in those receiving {TT} was erlotinib (60.7\%). In patients receiving {TT}, the median {PFS} was 13 months compared to 7 months in those receiving {CHT}; likewise, the median {OS} was 45 and 17 months, respectively. The {PFS} and {OS} curves showed significant differences (P {\textless} .05), achieving a better survival in subjects treated with {TT}.
{CONCLUSION}: Progression-Free Survival and {OS} were superior in patients who received targeted therapy than those treated only with {CHT}, the 2 years rate of {PFS} and {OS} was nearly double to those who received only {CHT}-based treatments.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma ({ATLL}) is an aggressive disease caused by the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1. Real-world data of {ATLL} in Latin America are lacking.
{PATIENTS} {AND} {METHODS}: We analyzed patients with {ATLL} (acute, lymphomatous, chronic, and smoldering) encountered in 11 Latin American countries between 1995 and 2019. Treatment response was assessed according to the 2009 consensus report. Survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test.
{RESULTS}: We identified 253 patients; 226 (lymphomatous: n = 122, acute: n = 73, chronic: n = 26, and smoldering: n = 5) had sufficient data for analysis (median age 57 years). Most patients with {ATLL} were from Peru (63\%), Chile (17\%), Argentina (8\%), and Colombia (7\%). Hypercalcemia was positively associated with acute type (57\% v lymphomatous 27\%, P = .014). The median survival times (months) were 4.3, 7.9, 21.1, and not reached for acute, lymphomatous, chronic, and smoldering forms, with 4-year survival rates of 8\%, 22\%, 40\%, and 80\%, respectively. First-line zidovudine ({AZT})-interferon alfa ({IFN}) resulted in an overall response rate of 63\% (complete response [{CR}] 24\%) for acute. First-line chemotherapy yielded an overall response rate of 41\% ({CR} 29\%) for lymphomatous. {CR} rate was 42\% for etoposide, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and prednisone versus 12\% for cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and prednisone-like regimen (P {\textless} .001). Progression-free survival at 1 year for acute type patients treated with {AZT}-{IFN} was 67\%, whereas 2-year progression-free survival in lymphomatous type patients who achieved {CR} after chemotherapy was 77\%.
{CONCLUSION}: This study confirms Latin American {ATLL} presents at a younger age and has a high incidence of lymphomatous type, low incidence of indolent subtypes, and worse survival rates as compared with Japanese patients. In aggressive {ATLL}, chemotherapy remains the preferred choice for lymphomatous favoring etoposide-based regimen (etoposide, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and prednisone), whereas {AZT}-{IFN} remains a good first-line option for acute subtype.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 ({HTLV}-1) is associated with aggressive diseases, such as adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma ({ATLL}). However, less is known on the impact of {HTLV}-1 infection in non-{ATLL} hematologic malignancies. We aimed to investigate if {HTLV}-1 carriers with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ({DLBCL}) have worse survival outcomes than non-{HTLV}-1 carriers.
{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}: We performed a single-center retrospective cohort study by matching {HTLV}-1 carriers to non-carriers based on age, sex, Ann Arbor stage, and year of diagnosis. Our outcomes of interest were overall survival ({OS}) and progression-free survival ({PFS}). The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate {OS} and {PFS} between carriers and non-carriers. We fitted multivariate Cox regression models to assess the mortality and recurrence/disease progression risk of {HTLV}-1 infection.
{RESULTS}: A total of 188 patients, 66 with {HTLV}-1 infection and 122 without {HTLV}-1, were included in the study. {HTLV}-1 carriers had higher extranodal involvement than non-carriers (47\% vs. 27\%, P = .010). With a median follow-up of 78 months (95\% {CI}: 41-90 months), {HTLV}-1 carriers had a similar 5 year {OS} (41\% vs. 42\%, P = .940) and {PFS} (34\% vs. 32\%, P = .691) compared to non-carriers. In the multivariate Cox analysis, {HTLV}-1 infection was not associated with worse {OS} ({aHR}: 0.98, 95\% {CI}: 0.64-1.50) or {PFS} ({aHR}: 0.90, 95\% {CI}: 0.60-1.34).
{CONCLUSION}: {HTLV}-1 carriers with {DLBCL} did not have worse survival outcomes compared to non-carriers. Our results suggest that clinicians should follow standard guidelines for {DLBCL} management on {HTLV}-1 seropositive patients.},

However, survival outcomes and treatment approaches over time in Latin American females are scarcely reported. We aimed to evaluate the temporal variation in treatment patterns and overall survival ({OS}) outcomes of females with {TNBC} according to cancer stage.
{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}: We performed a single-center retrospective cohort study on 1840 females from 2000 to 2014. Patients were classified in 3 calendar periods (2000-2004, 2005-2009, and 2010-2014). The Kaplan-Meier method and multivariable regression analyses were employed.
{RESULTS}: Stage {III} cancer was identified in half of the population. Five-year {OS} estimates for cancer stages I, {II}, and {IV} remained unchanged across all calendar periods. However, we found worsening 5-year {OS} estimates in stage {III} females (49\% in 2000-2004 and 31\% in 2010-2014; P {\textless} .001). Despite increased uptake of overall use of neoadjuvant therapy in stage {III} females, the time from diagnosis to treatment initiation (P = .013) and time to complete the planned cycles (P {\textless} .001) increased over time. Fifty-sex percent of stage {IV} patients were untreated. Females aged ≥70 years were less likely to receive treatment.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Survival estimates were lower than those reported in high-income countries. Most females were diagnosed with advanced disease, and the {OS} for stage {III} females worsened over time. Our outcomes show difficulties in delivering timely neoadjuvant therapy in an overwhelmed healthcare system.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Epidemiological studies commonly identify the clinical characteristics and survival outcomes of patients with breast cancer at five years. Our study aims to describe the sociodemographic, clinicopathological characteristics and determine the long-term event-free survival ({EFS}) and overall survival ({OS}) of a Peruvian population with triple-negative breast cancer.
{METHODS}: We reviewed the medical records of new cases treated at a single institution in the period 2000-2014. The survival analysis included patients with stages I-{IV}. Survival estimates at 10 years were calculated with the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the Log-rank test. We further used multivariate Cox regression analysis to calculate prognostic factors of recurrence and mortality.
{RESULTS}: Among the 2007 patients included, the median age at diagnosis was 49 years (19-95 years). Most patients presented histologic grade {III} (68.7\%), tumor stage {II} (34.2\%), and {III} (51.0\%) at diagnosis. Local and distant relapse was present in 31.9 and 51.4\% of the patients, respectively. The most frequent sites of metastasis were the lungs (14.5\%), followed by bone (9.7\%), brain (9.6\%), and liver (7.9\%). The median follow-up was 153 months. At 3, 5, and 10 years, the {EFS} of the population was 55\%, 49\%, and 41\%, respectively, while the {OS} was 64\%, 56\%, and 47\%, respectively. Moreover, an N3 lymph node status was the most important prognostic factor for both disease relapse ({HR}: 2.54, 95\% {CI}: 2.05-3.15) and mortality ({HR}: 2.51, 95\% {CI}: 2.01-3.14) at ten years. An older age and higher T staging were associated with a worse {OS}, while patients who received radiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy had better survival rates.
{CONCLUSION}: The sociodemographic features of Peruvian patients with {TNBC} are similar to those of other populations. However, our population was diagnosed at more advanced clinical stages, and thus, {EFS} and {OS} were lower than international reports while prognostic factors were similar to previous studies.},

It can occur as primary or de novo and be associated with myelodysplasia or myeloproliferative neoplasms. The most frequent locations are the skin, lymph nodes and bones. The case of a patient with a diagnosis of primary granulocytic de novo gastric {MS} is reported.
{CASE} {SUMMARY}: A 19-year-old female patient with {MS}, whose abdominal computed tomography showed a bulky tumor of 16.5 cm in the gastric chamber with infiltration in the retroperitoneal, pancreatic and bile duct region; the histological study showed gastric mucosa diffusely infiltrated by mononucleated cells and the immunohistochemistry expressed myeloperoxidase. After receiving induction chemotherapy based on the 3 + 7 regimen (daunorubicin/cytarabine), the patient developed severe hematological toxicity and neutropenic typhlitis which required a prolonged medical treatment. She presented a rapid disease progression. Although she received supportive treatment, the patient died.
{CONCLUSION}: Gastric primary de novo {MS} is a rare and aggressive course neoplasm, fostering knowledge is very important to decide its management and to promote more approaches focused on understanding this pathology and its particularities in our population.},

However, a standard of care for managing adolescents and young adults ({AYAs}) with {DLBCL} is lacking. We examine treatment approaches and outcomes of this population. Methods: We included 90 {AYAs} (15-39 years) diagnosed with {DLBCL} between 2008 and 2018 in three tertiary centers in Peru. Overall response rates ({ORR}) were available for all patients. Overall survival ({OS}) and progression-free survival ({PFS}) rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: The median age at diagnosis was 33 years, 57\% were males, 57\% had good performance status (Lansky/Karnofsky ≥90), and 61\% were diagnosed with early-stage disease (Ann Arbor stages I-{II}). R-{CHOP} (n = 69, 77\%) was the most frequently used first-line regimen, with an {ORR} of 91\%. With a median follow-up of 83 months, the 5-year {OS} and {PFS} among all patients were 79\% and 67\%, respectively. Among the patients who received R-{CHOP}, the 5-year {OS} and {PFS} were 77\% and 66\%, respectively. Of the 29 (32\%) patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) disease, 83\% received second-line treatment and only 14\% underwent consolidation therapy with autologous transplantation. The 3-year {OS} for R/R {DLBCL} was 36\%. Conclusion: Our data show that {AYAs} with {DLBCL} who received conventional therapy had comparable outcomes to those observed in studies conducted among the adult population. However, the prognosis for {AYAs} with R/R disease was dismal, indicating the unmet need for developing and increasing access to novel treatment modalities in {AYAs}.},

Coinfection with Strongyloides promotes {ATL} development, suggesting that the immunological status of infected individuals is a determinant of {HTLV}-1 pathogenicity. As {CD}4+ T cells play a central role in host immunity, the deregulation of their function and differentiation via {HTLV}-1 promotes the immune evasion of infected T cells. During {ATL} development, the accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations in key host immunity-related genes further disturbs the immunological balance. Various approaches are available for treating these abnormalities; however, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is currently the only treatment with the potential to cure {ATL}. The patient’s immune state may contribute to the treatment outcome. Additionally, the activity of the anti-{CC} chemokine receptor 4 antibody, mogamulizumab, depends on immune function, including antibody-dependent cytotoxicity. In this comprehensive review, we summarize the immunopathogenesis of {HTLV}-1 infection in {ATL} and discuss the clinical findings that should be considered when developing treatment strategies for {ATL}.},

Limited data exist on whether management practices in these countries affect patient outcomes. We assessed the real-world treatment approaches and outcomes of patients with {KS} in Peru. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related {KS} ({AIDS}-related {KS}; n = 95) and classic {KS} ({CKS}; n = 81) diagnosed at a tertiary center between 2000 and 2014 in Lima, Peru. We used the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate overall survival ({OS}) rates. The median follow-up was 64 months for {AIDS}-related {KS} and 88 months for {CKS}. The median age of patients with {AIDS}-related {KS} was 35 years (range 20-63 years) and 70 years (range 33-91 years) for those with {CKS}. Most individuals had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of ≥ 2 ({AIDS}-related {KS} 75\%; {CKS} 85\%). Seventy-six percent and 40\% of individuals with {AIDS}-related {KS} and {CKS}, respectively, received systemic chemotherapy. The most common first-line drug was paclitaxel, with relatively optimal overall response rates ({ORRs}) for {AIDS}-related {KS} (n = 64/72, 89\%; {ORR} 61\%) and {CKS} (n = 24/32, 75\%; {ORR} 50\%). The 5-year {OS} rates were 71\% in the {AIDS}-related {KS} cohort and 81\% in the {CKS} cohort.

	abstract = {Purpose: Outcomes of females with triple-negative breast cancer ({TNBC}) are rarely explored in adolescents and young adults ({AYAs}). We compared clinical and survival outcomes of Latin American {AYAs} (≤39 years) with middle-aged (40–59 years) and older (≥60 years) females with {TNBC} by cancer stage. Methods: We performed a single-center retrospective cohort study among treated females with cancer stages I–{III} diagnosed from 2000 to 2014 in Peru. We evaluated overall survival ({OS}) and event-free survival ({EFS}). Time-to-event methods were used for analyses. Results: Of 1582 females with {TNBC}, 350 (22\%) were {AYAs}, 887 (56\%) were middle-aged, and 345 (22\%) were older women. Tumor size {\textgreater}5 cm, histological grade {III}, and brain metastasis were more common features in {AYAs}. {AYAs} were treated more frequently with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. With a median follow-up of 102 months, the 5-year {OS}/{EFS} for {AYAs} was 55\%/53\%, similar to middle-aged (54\%/49\%) and older females (56\%/51\%). {AYAs} were not at higher risk for decreased {OS} or {EFS} in the multivariable Cox analysis. Our findings remained consistent by cancer stage. Conclusion: Although Latin American {AYAs} with {TNBC} have more aggressive clinical features at diagnosis, survival outcomes were comparable with middle-aged and older women with {TNBC}, suggesting that age is not a risk factor for worse survival outcomes if treatment is given according to cancer stage. Our findings should be interpreted with caution given the lack of information on certain covariates such as comorbidities. Strategies for early detection in primary care and prompt referral for treatment initiation should be developed.},

	abstract = {Background. Breast cancer is an important cause of cancer-related death in women worldwide and represents the second most frequent cause of brain metastases after lung cancer. The aim of this study was to determine the characteristics and outcomes of triple-negative breast cancer ({TNBC}) patients with brain metastasis ({BM}). Methods. We retrospectively reviewed a cohort of patients diagnosed with {TNBC} at the "Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplasicas"(period 2000-2014) to evaluate patients who developed {BM}. Survival rates were assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method, and prognostic factors were identified with the Cox regression analysis. Results. Of a total of 2007 {TNBC} patients, 193 (9.62\%) developed {BM}. Of these, 169 stages I-{III} patients with a median age of 45 years (range:21-78) were included. The stage in this cohort was 4 (2.4\%) clinical stage ({CS}) I, 23 (13.6\%) with {CS} {II} and 142 (84.0\%) with {CS} {III}. Most of these patients presented {ECOG} ≥2 (68.6\%). The most common symptom was headache (74.0\%), followed by nausea-vomiting (46.7\%). Imaging showed that 80 patients (53.0\%) had ≥1 metastatic brain lesion. Regarding the treatment of {BM} in this cohort, 132 patients (84.6\%) received radiotherapy ({RT}), 2 (1.5\%) surgery, and 6 (4.5\%) surgery plus {RT}. The overall survival ({OS}) rate of {BM} was 59.8\%, 37.3\%, and 15.0\% at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. A multivariate analysis showed {RT} to be the only factor with a positive impact on the {OS} of {BM} (hazard ratio ({HR}) = 0.48, 95\% confidence interval ({CI}):0.30-0.77, and p=0.002), while {ECOG} ≥2 was associated with a worse {OS} ({HR} = 1.69, 95\%{CI}:1.15-2.48, and p=0.007). Conclusion. Despite the poor prognosis of {TNBC} patients who develop {BM}, {RT} showed a benefit in {OS} rates, while {ECOG} ≥2 was the only prognostic factor associated with a worse {OS}.

	abstract = {Epstein-Barr virus ({EBV}) is a potent carcinogen linked to hematologic and solid malignancies and causes significant global morbidity and mortality. Therapy using allogeneic {EBV}-specific lymphocytes shows promise in certain populations, but the impact of {EBV} genome variation on these strategies remains unexplored. To address this, we sequenced 217 {EBV} genomes, including hematologic malignancies from Guatemala, Peru, Malawi, and Taiwan, and analyzed them alongside 1307 publicly available {EBV} genomes from cancer, nonmalignant diseases, and healthy individuals across Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, and South America. These included, to our knowledge, the first natural killer ({NK})/T-cell lymphoma ({NKTCL}) {EBV} genomes reported outside of East Asia. Our findings indicate that previously proposed {EBV} genome variants specific to certain cancer types are more closely tied to geographic origin than to cancer histology. This included variants previously reported to be specific to {NKTCL} but were prevalent in {EBV} genomes from other cancer types and healthy individuals in East Asia. After controlling for geographic region, we did identify multiple {NKTCL}-specific variants associated with a 7.8-fold to 21.9-fold increased risk. We also observed frequent variations in {EBV} genomes that affected peptide sequences previously reported to bind common major histocompatibility complex alleles. Finally, we found several nonsynonymous variants spanning the coding sequences of current vaccine targets {BALF}4, {BKRF}2, {BLLF}1, {BXLF}2, {BZLF}1, and {BZLF}2. These results highlight the need to consider geographic variation in {EBV} genomes when devising strategies for exploiting adaptive immune responses against {EBV}-related cancers, ensuring greater global effectiveness and equity in prevention and treatment. © 2024 by The American Society of Hematology.},

However, a standard of care for managing adolescents and young adults ({AYAs}) with {DLBCL} is lacking. We examine treatment approaches and outcomes of this population. Methods: We included 90 {AYAs} (15-39 years) diagnosed with {DLBCL} between 2008 and 2018 in three tertiary centers in Peru. Overall response rates ({ORR}) were available for all patients. Overall survival ({OS}) and progression-free survival ({PFS}) rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: The median age at diagnosis was 33 years, 57\% were males, 57\% had good performance status (Lansky/Karnofsky ≥90), and 61\% were diagnosed with early-stage disease (Ann Arbor stages I-{II}). R-{CHOP} (n = 69, 77\%) was the most frequently used first-line regimen, with an {ORR} of 91\%. With a median follow-up of 83 months, the 5-year {OS} and {PFS} among all patients were 79\% and 67\%, respectively. Among the patients who received R-{CHOP}, the 5-year {OS} and {PFS} were 77\% and 66\%, respectively. Of the 29 (32\%) patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) disease, 83\% received second-line treatment and only 14\% underwent consolidation therapy with autologous transplantation. The 3-year {OS} for R/R {DLBCL} was 36\%. Conclusion: Our data show that {AYAs} with {DLBCL} who received conventional therapy had comparable outcomes to those observed in studies conducted among the adult population. However, the prognosis for {AYAs} with R/R disease was dismal, indicating the unmet need for developing and increasing access to novel treatment modalities in {AYAs}.},

Materials and methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted, including pediatric patients from one month old to less than 14 years of age, hospitalized between May 2020 and December 31, 2021, at the Edgardo Rebagliati-Martins National Hospital. The exposure variable was age, categorized in six-month intervals. The outcome variable was the severity of {COVID}-19, determined according to the severity criteria established in the {EsSalud} Clinical Practice Guidelines for the management of {COVID}-19 in pediatrics. Crude and adjusted relative risks ({RR}) were estimated, with their respective 95\% confidence intervals (95\% {CI}). Results: Three-hundred and thirty-one patients were analyzed, their median age was 94 months (7,8 years), and the male-to-female ratio was 1.23. Comorbidities were present in 59.5\% of the patients, with neurological disorders being the most common (13.9\%). Fatalities were 3.3\% of the whole sample, and 63.6\% of them were severe cases. Severe {COVID}-19 was found in 9.4\% of the sample. In the adjusted regression model, increasing age was not found to be a predictor of reduced risk of {COVID}-19 severity (adjusted {RR}= 1.02; 95\% {CI} 0.98-1.06).

To systematically evaluate and synthesize the existing evidence from cohort and case-control studies to identify risk factors associated with malignant progression to {ATLL} in {HTLV}-1 carriers.
Methods
A systematic search was conducted in September 2023 in the following databases: Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, Medline and Embase. Only case-control and cohort studies that assessed the risk factors for the malignant progression to {ATLL} among {HTLV}-1 carriers in the adult population were included. The risk of bias was assessed through the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Meta-analysis was not performed due to high statistical and methodological heterogeneity.
Results
After conducting a systematic search, 8,170 results were retrieved, of which 9 (7 case-control and 2 cohort studies) met the selection criteria. Seven of them were conducted in Japan and six had low risk of bias. Serum {sIL}-2R levels, proviral load ({PVL}), cigarette consumption, Scd30 and {TNF}-α-857T allele were associated with an increased risk of {ATLL} progression.
Conclusion
{PVL} emerges as the foremost recommended biomarker for predicting progression in patients with {HTLV}-1 associated {ATLL}. Further studies with larger samples sizes, different populations, more rigorous statistical adjustments, and longer follow-up are warranted.},
